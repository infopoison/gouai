**Defining GOUAI Protocol**

I'm currently engaged in understanding the GOUAI Protocol. I'm focusing on its core components, especially the reformulation aspects. My initial assessment is complete. I'm moving toward reviewing the `PARENT_TASK_DEFINITION_CONTENT` and beginning the reformulation of the PARENT_HLG and PARENT_WSOD.


**Analyzing the Initial Task**

I've examined the user's initial high-level goal, focusing on its implications. I've begun to define the key steps involved, like script creation, zipping, and emailing. My next step involves constructing a preliminary Workable Stated Output Descriptor (WSOD) based on this assessment. I'm aiming for clarity in these early stages, setting a solid foundation for the subsequent phases.


**Outlining Phase 1 Subtasks**

I've moved into delineating Phase 1 subtasks based on the initial HLG and the requirements of the GOUAI protocol. I am focusing on breaking down "create a python script that prints hello world," "place it in a zip file," and "email it to myself" into a set of actionable subtasks that will be clearly defined. The goal is to provide a comprehensive, initial outline for the overall project, ensuring a detailed understanding of the components involved.



**Developing Phase 1 Subtasks**

I'm now generating sub-tasks for Phase 1.  I've assessed the high-level goal, focusing on its implications and necessary components. The plan involves outlining key stages like initial script creation, zipping, and emailing. My immediate objective is to craft a workable Stated Output Descriptor, offering a robust foundation for the upcoming stages.


**Developing Deeper Understanding**

I'm now in the process of formulating a clearer understanding of the protocol. I'm focusing on the sub-task breakdown for Phase 1 and aiming to define the HLG, uncertainties, and information requirements for each. My current objective is to have a comprehensive understanding of the user's requirements to ensure a seamless workflow.


**Refining the Initial Goal**

I'm now outlining Phase 1 subtasks, focusing on the initial high-level goal. The goal is to break it down into actionable sub-tasks. I'm prioritizing the creation of a workable stated output descriptor, clarifying uncertainties and addressing each requirement. I'm concentrating on the structure, defining uncertainties, and the information required.


**Developing Phase 1 Subtasks**

I've outlined sub-tasks for Phase 1, prioritizing understanding the user's requirements. We're dissecting "create python script," "zip the file," and "email it," aiming to define the HLG, uncertainties, and information demands for each. This granular breakdown provides a clear path towards developing a comprehensive WSOD for the project.


**Elaborating on Phase 1 Subtasks**

I'm now diving deeper into refining the initial goal, with a clear focus on the sub-tasks for Phase 1.  I'm concentrating on defining the HLG, uncertainties, and information requirements for each. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the user's requirements to support the creation of a seamless workflow.


**Elaborating on Phase 1 Subtasks**

I'm now deep-diving into the Phase 1 subtasks. I've concentrated on refining the initial high-level goal into smaller, actionable segments. For each sub-task, I'm defining the HLG, outlining uncertainties, and determining key information requirements. The aim is to create a comprehensive understanding of the user's needs, paving the way for a smooth and efficient workflow.


**Defining SMTP Parameters**

I've specified the SMTP parameters, including the sender and recipient addresses, email subject, body content, server details, and authentication method. I've also identified the user's meta-goals for the task. The next step is to prepare the final Workable Stated Output Descriptor based on this information.


**Clarifying Phase 1 Focus**

I'm focused on developing the Phase 1 subtasks based on the initial high-level goal, "to create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself." I'm also ensuring a thorough understanding of the user's requirements to create a robust workable output descriptor.


**Developing Clearer Objectives**

I'm now focusing on a more granular breakdown of Phase 1, emphasizing clarity around sub-tasks. I'm prioritizing establishing a workable output descriptor. The intention is to refine the high-level goal into actionable elements, defining the HLG, uncertainties, and information requisites for each component.


# PARENT TASK ANALYSIS
## PARENT_HLG
to create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself.

## PARENT_WSOD
To be defined.

# PROPOSED SUB-TASKS

## SUB-TASK: Clarify Python Script Details
### HLG
To identify and specify the precise requirements for the "hello world" Python script, including its content, environment, and naming conventions, in order to contribute to a comprehensive Workable Stated Output Descriptor.
### EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTIES
- Exact Python version (e.g., 3.x, specific minor) to be used for script execution.
- Specific content of the "hello world" output (e.g., plain string, formatted output, includes date/time).
- Any required script headers, comments, or docstrings.
- Desired script filename and extension.
- Whether external dependencies are allowed or required for any future expansion beyond "hello world".
### KEY_INFORMATION_REQUIREMENTS
- User's preferred Python interpreter version.
- Specific "Hello World" output string requirements.
- Desired filename for the Python script.
- Any specific coding style preferences (e.g., PEP8, simple).

## SUB-TASK: Define Zip File Specifications
### HLG
To determine the precise structure, naming, and content of the zip file, ensuring it appropriately encapsulates the Python script for subsequent emailing, as a component of the overall Workable Stated Output Descriptor.
### EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTIES
- The desired name for the zip file itself.
- Whether the Python script should be directly at the root of the zip or within a subdirectory.
- Are there any additional files (e.g., README, license, environment setup instructions) that should be included in the zip file?
- Any specific compression level or encryption requirements for the zip file.
### KEY_INFORMATION_REQUIREMENTS
- User's desired zip file name.
- Desired directory structure within the zip file.
- List of any additional files to include in the zip.
- Any specific compression or security settings.

## SUB-TASK: Specify Emailing Parameters
### HLG
To delineate all necessary email parameters, including sender/recipient details, message content, and SMTP server configuration, to enable reliable delivery of the zip file, thereby completing the scope definition for the Workable Stated Output Descriptor.
### EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTIES
- Confirmation of the specific sender and recipient email addresses (even if "myself").
- The exact content and structure for the email subject line and body.
- Detailed SMTP server configuration (host, port, security protocols like SSL/TLS).
- The preferred method for SMTP authentication (e.g., direct password, application-specific password, OAuth token).
- Expected behavior or error handling if email sending fails.
### KEY_INFORMATION_REQUIREMENTS
- Sender email address and display name (if any).
- Recipient email address.
- Desired email subject line.
- Desired email body text.
- SMTP server address and port.
- SMTP authentication type and required credentials.

## SUB-TASK: Uncover Meta-Goals and Constraints
### HLG
To identify the user's underlying motivations, values, and non-functional requirements (e.g., security, robustness, ease of use) for this task, ensuring the Workable Stated Output Descriptor truly serves the broader purpose and context.
### EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTIES
- Whether this is a learning exercise, a test of system capabilities, or a precursor to a more complex automation.
- The importance of error handling and robustness in the final script.
- Security considerations regarding credentials for email and file handling.
- Desired level of user interaction for the final script (e.g., fully automated, prompts for input).
- Any implicit constraints on tools, libraries, or execution environment.
### KEY_INFORMATION_REQUIREMENTS
- User's primary motivation for executing this task.
- Specific non-functional requirements (e.g., security, performance, maintainability).
- Definition of "success" beyond just completion (e.g., ease of use, reusability).
- Any specific platform or operating system constraints.
