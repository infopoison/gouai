## High-Level Goal(s) (HLG)

To identify and specify the precise requirements for the "hello world" Python script, including its content, environment, and naming conventions, in order to contribute to a comprehensive Workable Stated Output Descriptor.

Key Epistemic Uncertainties:
- Exact Python version (e.g., 3.x, specific minor) to be used for script execution.
- Specific content of the "hello world" output (e.g., plain string, formatted output, includes date/time).
- Any required script headers, comments, or docstrings.
- Desired script filename and extension.
- Whether external dependencies are allowed or required for any future expansion beyond "hello world".

Key Information Requirements:
- User's preferred Python interpreter version.
- Specific "Hello World" output string requirements.
- Desired filename for the Python script.
- Any specific coding style preferences (e.g., PEP8, simple).
