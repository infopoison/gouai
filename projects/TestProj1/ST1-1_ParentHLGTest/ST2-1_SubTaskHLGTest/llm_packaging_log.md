**Full Meta-Prompt with Dynamic Context Bundle Sent to LLM1:**
```

**Objective:** You are a GOUAI Packaging LLM (LLM1). Your primary function is to process the provided contextual information for a GOUAI (Goal-Oriented Uncertainty-Aware AI) task and generate a structured, comprehensive "Priming Prompt". This Priming Prompt will be used to brief another expert AI assistant (LLM2) who will subsequently assist the user with the GOUAI task.

**Instructions for Generating the Priming Prompt:**

1.  **Core Task Identification:**
    * The user is engaged with GOUAI task ID: `TestProj1_ROOT_ST1-1_ParentHLGTest_ST2-1_SubTaskHLGTest`
    * Key definitional elements from `task_definition.md`:
        * `HLG Summary`: `to create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself.`
        * `WSOD Summary`: `To be defined.`
        * `Current Task Status`: `Not Started`
        * `Key Epistemic Uncertainties (from WSOD Assessment)`: `(To be filled during GOUAI Phase 1 for this task)
### Epistemic Uncertainties
(List identified epistemic uncertainties related to achieving the WSOD for this sub-task. Consider any uncertainties inherited or implied by the parent task's context or the nature of this sub-task's HLG.)
### Aleatoric Uncertainties
(List identified aleatoric uncertainties related to this sub-task.)
### HLG Alignment/Risk
(Assess alignment with this sub-task's HLG and any risks.)
### Key Information Requirements

        * `IE Uncertainty Overview (from Phase 2)`: `(To be filled during GOUAI Phase 2 for this task)`

2.  **User's Current Working Context (from `living_document.md`):**
    * `Key Questions or Uncertainties (from Living Document)`: `(Log questions, evolving uncertainties, and insights here)`
    * `Recent Chronological Log Entries (approx. last 5)`: `(Record key actions, decisions, and dates here as the task progresses)`

3.  **Supporting Contextual Files (from `context_packages/`):**
    * The following text-based files and their content are provided:
        `No files found in context_packages/.`
    * The following non-text files are also part of the context (their content is not directly viewable by you, but their presence should be noted):
        `None`
    * Your task is to synthesize the key information from the provided text-based files. Extract salient points, summaries, or direct quotes that are most relevant to the overall task goal and current uncertainties.

4.  **Structure for the Priming Prompt (Output for LLM2):**
    * Your output *must* be a single, coherent block of text, formatted in Markdown, precisely as follows. This is the Priming Prompt for LLM2.
    * Do *not* add any conversational elements outside of this defined structure.

**LLM1 Request Timestamp:** `2025-05-20 18:28:50`

**Full Meta-Prompt with Dynamic Context Bundle Sent to LLM1:**
```

**Objective:** You are a GOUAI Packaging LLM (LLM1). Your primary function is to process the provided contextual information for a GOUAI (Goal-Oriented Uncertainty-Aware AI) task and generate a structured, comprehensive "Priming Prompt". This Priming Prompt will be used to brief another expert AI assistant (LLM2) who will subsequently assist the user with the GOUAI task.

**Instructions for Generating the Priming Prompt:**

1.  **Core Task Identification:**
    * The user is engaged with GOUAI task ID: `TestProj1_ROOT_ST1-1_ParentHLGTest_ST2-1_SubTaskHLGTest`
    * Key definitional elements from `task_definition.md`:
        * `HLG Summary`: `to create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself.`
        * `WSOD Summary`: `To be defined.`
        * `Current Task Status`: `Not Started`
        * `Key Epistemic Uncertainties (from WSOD Assessment)`: `(To be filled during GOUAI Phase 1 for this task)
### Epistemic Uncertainties
(List identified epistemic uncertainties related to achieving the WSOD for this sub-task. Consider any uncertainties inherited or implied by the parent task's context or the nature of this sub-task's HLG.)
### Aleatoric Uncertainties
(List identified aleatoric uncertainties related to this sub-task.)
### HLG Alignment/Risk
(Assess alignment with this sub-task's HLG and any risks.)
### Key Information Requirements
(List key information required to resolve uncertainties or complete the WSOD for this sub-task.)`

        * `IE Uncertainty Overview (from Phase 2)`: `(To be filled during GOUAI Phase 2 for this task)`

2.  **User's Current Working Context (from `living_document.md`):**
    * `Key Questions or Uncertainties (from Living Document)`: `(Log questions, evolving uncertainties, and insights here)`
    * `Recent Chronological Log Entries (approx. last 5)`: `(Record key actions, decisions, and dates here as the task progresses)`

3.  **Supporting Contextual Files (from `context_packages/`):**
    * The following text-based files and their content are provided:
        `No files found in context_packages/.`
    * The following non-text files are also part of the context (their content is not directly viewable by you, but their presence should be noted):
        `None`
    * Your task is to synthesize the key information from the provided text-based files. Extract salient points, summaries, or direct quotes that are most relevant to the overall task goal and current uncertainties.

4.  **Structure for the Priming Prompt (Output for LLM2):**
    * Your output *must* be a single, coherent block of text, formatted in Markdown, precisely as follows. This is the Priming Prompt for LLM2.
    * Do *not* add any conversational elements outside of this defined structure.

**Full Meta-Prompt with Dynamic Context Bundle Sent to LLM1:**
```

**Objective:** You are a GOUAI Packaging LLM (LLM1). Your primary function is to process the provided contextual information for a GOUAI (Goal-Oriented Uncertainty-Aware AI) task and generate a structured, comprehensive "Priming Prompt". This Priming Prompt will be used to brief another expert AI assistant (LLM2) who will subsequently assist the user with the GOUAI task.

**Instructions for Generating the Priming Prompt:**

1.  **Core Task Identification:**
    * The user is engaged with GOUAI task ID: `TestProj1_ROOT_ST1-1_ParentHLGTest_ST2-1_SubTaskHLGTest`
    * Key definitional elements from `task_definition.md`:
        * `HLG Summary`: `to create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself.`
        * `WSOD Summary`: `To be defined.`
        * `Current Task Status`: `Not Started`
        * `Key Epistemic Uncertainties (from WSOD Assessment)`: `(To be filled during GOUAI Phase 1 for this task)
### Epistemic Uncertainties
(List identified epistemic uncertainties related to achieving the WSOD for this sub-task. Consider any uncertainties inherited or implied by the parent task's context or the nature of this sub-task's HLG.)
### Aleatoric Uncertainties

2.  **User's Current Working Context (from `living_document.md`):**
    * `Key Questions or Uncertainties (from Living Document)`: `(Log questions, evolving uncertainties, and insights here)`
    * `Recent Chronological Log Entries (approx. last 5)`: `(Record key actions, decisions, and dates here as the task progresses)`

3.  **Supporting Contextual Files (from `context_packages/`):**
    * The following text-based files and their content are provided:
        `No files found in context_packages/.`
    * The following non-text files are also part of the context (their content is not directly viewable by you, but their presence should be noted):
        `None`
    * Your task is to synthesize the key information from the provided text-based files. Extract salient points, summaries, or direct quotes that are most relevant to the overall task goal and current uncertainties.

4.  **Structure for the Priming Prompt (Output for LLM2):**
    * Your output *must* be a single, coherent block of text, formatted in Markdown, precisely as follows. This is the Priming Prompt for LLM2.
    * Do *not* add any conversational elements outside of this defined structure.

**LLM1 Request Timestamp:** `2025-05-20 18:52:00`

**Full Meta-Prompt with Dynamic Context Bundle Sent to LLM1:**
```

**Objective:** You are a GOUAI Packaging LLM (LLM1). Your primary function is to process the provided contextual information for a GOUAI (Goal-Oriented Uncertainty-Aware AI) task and generate a structured, comprehensive "Priming Prompt". This Priming Prompt will be used to brief another expert AI assistant (LLM2) who will subsequently assist the user with the GOUAI task.

**Instructions for Generating the Priming Prompt:**

1.  **Core Task Identification:**
    * The user is engaged with GOUAI task ID: `TestProj1_ROOT_ST1-1_ParentHLGTest_ST2-1_SubTaskHLGTest`
    * Key definitional elements from `task_definition.md`:
        * `HLG Summary`: `to create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself.`
        * `WSOD Summary`: `To be defined.`
        * `Current Task Status`: `Not Started`
        * `Key Epistemic Uncertainties (from WSOD Assessment)`: `(To be filled during GOUAI Phase 1 for this task)
### Epistemic Uncertainties
(List identified epistemic uncertainties related to achieving the WSOD for this sub-task. Consider any uncertainties inherited or implied by the parent task's context or the nature of this sub-task's HLG.)

    * `Recent Chronological Log Entries (approx. last 5)`: `(Record key actions, decisions, and dates here as the task progresses)`

3.  **Supporting Contextual Files (from `context_packages/`):**
    * The following text-based files and their content are provided:
        `No files found in context_packages/.`
    * The following non-text files are also part of the context (their content is not directly viewable by you, but their presence should be noted):
        `None`
    * Your task is to synthesize the key information from the provided text-based files. Extract salient points, summaries, or direct quotes that are most relevant to the overall task goal and current uncertainties.

4.  **Structure for the Priming Prompt (Output for LLM2):**
    * Your output *must* be a single, coherent block of text, formatted in Markdown, precisely as follows. This is the Priming Prompt for LLM2.
    * Do *not* add any conversational elements outside of this defined structure.

**Composing a Priming Prompt**

I'm currently working on crafting the perfect priming prompt for LLM2. I've broken down the user's instructions and am focusing on identifying the core components. I'm prioritizing clarity and conciseness to ensure LLM2 understands its role in generating packaging copy. The contextual information will be integrated strategically to guide LLM2 effectively. I'm aiming for a prompt that is both informative and efficient.


**Constructing the Priming Prompt**

I've moved on to the next phase: populating the user's focus and recent activity within the prompt. I'm focusing on the "placeholder" text and making sure it's accurately reproduced. I've also processed the lack of context files and am adapting my approach. The aim is to create a comprehensive and accurate priming prompt.


**Developing the Priming Prompt**

I'm now integrating the provided information into the prompt structure. I've accurately captured the "Not Started" status and the specific task ID. My focus is on ensuring the placeholder text for epistemic uncertainties, information requirements, and user questions are correctly and completely reproduced. The absence of context files necessitates a clear statement within the prompt, which I've addressed in the synthesis.


**Crafting the Final Prompt**

I'm now focusing on final assembly, ensuring all placeholders are replaced according to instructions. The context file absence requires a specific statement, which I've included. I'm carefully reviewing the structure to eliminate any unnecessary conversational elements. The detailed breakdowns are ready, and I'm prepared to synthesize them into a concise, accurate priming prompt.


**Generating the Final Prompt**

I've completed the extraction and mapping of all provided data into the prompt. All placeholders have been replaced according to the user's specifications. The absence of context files has been explicitly addressed within the synthesis. The final priming prompt is now ready for presentation.

**Refining Prompt Structure**

I'm working to distill the user's instructions into a precise priming prompt for LLM2. My focus is now on ensuring the prompt's structure adheres perfectly to the specifications outlined in section 4. I'm carefully analyzing the provided contextual data bundle to extract the necessary information and shape it appropriately.


**Mapping Data to Template**

I'm now fully immersed in the meticulous process of mapping the contextual data bundle to the required Priming Prompt sections. My attention is primarily on extracting the necessary information from `task_definition.md`. I'm using the provided instructions to ensure the correct data is extracted for the  `HLG Summary`, `WSOD Summary`, and `Current Task Status`. I've made the necessary adjustment regarding the "duplicate" sections on uncertainties, and am now handling the user's focus and recent activity.


**Formulating the Prompt**

I've outlined the critical steps for building the Priming Prompt. Now, I'm ready to synthesize the relevant information from the contextual data. I'll meticulously populate each section of the prompt template, ensuring that the final output accurately reflects the user's instructions and the provided data. Specifically, I'll copy the provided "Key Epistemic Uncertainties" verbatim as specified in the template instruction.
