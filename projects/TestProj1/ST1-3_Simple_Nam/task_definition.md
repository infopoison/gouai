## Task Description

To determine the precise structure, naming, and content of the zip file, ensuring it appropriately encapsulates the Python script for subsequent emailing, as a component of the overall Workable Stated Output Descriptor.

(This is a simple task. Formal GOUAI sections are not applicable. Outputs should be stored in the 'outputs/' directory, and LLM interactions logged in 'llm_conversation_log.md'.)
