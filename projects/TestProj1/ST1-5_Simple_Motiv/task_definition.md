## Task Description

To identify the user's underlying motivations, values, and non-functional requirements (e.g., security, robustness, ease of use) for this task, ensuring the Workable Stated Output Descriptor truly serves the broader purpose and context.

(This is a simple task. Formal GOUAI sections are not applicable. Outputs should be stored in the 'outputs/' directory, and LLM interactions logged in 'llm_conversation_log.md'.)
