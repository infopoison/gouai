## Task Description

To identify the user's underlying motivations, values, and non-functional requirements (e.g., security, robustness, ease of use) for this task, ensuring the Workable Stated Output Descriptor truly serves the broader purpose and context.

### Initial Epistemic Uncertainties (from parent decomposition):
- Whether this is a learning exercise, a test of system capabilities, or a precursor to a more complex automation.
- The importance of error handling and robustness in the final script.
- Security considerations regarding credentials for email and file handling.
- Desired level of user interaction for the final script (e.g., fully automated, prompts for input).
- Any implicit constraints on tools, libraries, or execution environment.

### Initial Key Information Requirements (from parent decomposition):
- User's primary motivation for executing this task.
- Specific non-functional requirements (e.g., security, performance, maintainability).
- Definition of "success" beyond just completion (e.g., ease of use, reusability).
- Any specific platform or operating system constraints.

(This is a simple task. Formal GOUAI sections are not applicable. Outputs should be stored in the 'outputs/' directory, and LLM interactions logged in 'llm_conversation_log.md'.)
