## Task Description

To determine the precise structure, naming, and content of the zip file, ensuring it appropriately encapsulates the Python script for subsequent emailing, as a component of the overall Workable Stated Output Descriptor.

### Initial Epistemic Uncertainties (from parent decomposition):
- The desired name for the zip file itself.
- Whether the Python script should be directly at the root of the zip or within a subdirectory.
- Are there any additional files (e.g., README, license, environment setup instructions) that should be included in the zip file?
- Any specific compression level or encryption requirements for the zip file.

### Initial Key Information Requirements (from parent decomposition):
- User's desired zip file name.
- Desired directory structure within the zip file.
- List of any additional files to include in the zip.
- Any specific compression or security settings.

(This is a simple task. Formal GOUAI sections are not applicable. Outputs should be stored in the 'outputs/' directory, and LLM interactions logged in 'llm_conversation_log.md'.)
