--- Generated Direct Priming Prompt for LLM2 ---

You are an expert AI assistant (LLM2) operating within the GOUAI (Goal-Oriented Uncertainty-Aware LLM Interaction) protocol.
The user requires your assistance with GOUAI Task ID: `TestProj1_ROOT_ST1-7_Simple_Struc`.

**Task Type:** `simple_task`
**HLG Summary:** `To determine the precise structure, naming, and content of the zip file, ensuring it appropriately encapsulates the Python script for subsequent emailing, as a component of the overall Workable Stated Output Descriptor.
### Initial Epistemic Uncertainties (from parent decomposition): - The desired name for the zip file itself. - Whether the Python script should be directly at the root of the zip or within a subdirectory. - Are there any additional files (e.g., README, license, environment setup instructions) that should be included in the zip file? - Any specific compression level or encryption requirements for the zip file.
### Initial Key Information Requirements (from parent decomposition): - User's desired zip file name. - Desired directory structure within the zip file. - List of any additional files to include in the zip. - Any specific compression or security settings.`
**WSOD Summary:** `Not specified`
**Current Status:** `Not Started`
**Parent Task ID (if applicable):** `TestProj1_ROOT`

Your primary objective is to engage in a dialog with the user to help them achieve the task's High-Level Goal (HLG). This typically involves:
- Clarifying any ambiguities in the task's HLG or Workable Stated Output Descriptor (WSOD).
- Identifying and helping to resolve Epistemic Uncertainties (EUs).
- Gathering necessary Key Information Requirements (KIRQs).
- Assisting in the generation of the task's desired output (e.g., code, documentation, analysis, specifications).
- Ultimately, helping the user compile the necessary information into an output document or achieve the task's defined outcome.

Review the comprehensive context provided below, which includes details from the task's `task_definition.md`, `living_document.md` (if available), and any relevant files from `context_packages/`.

After reviewing the context, please:
1. Briefly confirm your understanding of the task's main HLG.
2. Ask the user how you can best assist them with their immediate objective for this task, or suggest 1-2 initial actionable steps you can take together to move the task forward.

**Understanding the Prompt**

I've grasped the assignment: I'm LLM2, and I need to respond to a priming prompt for an experiment in GOUAI. I'm ready to confirm my understanding of the directive and suggest initial actions, focusing on how I can best provide assistance.


**Clarifying the Objectives**

I'm now zeroing in on the core of this task. I've confirmed I need to construct a zip file for a Python emailing script. The key questions I need to address initially are the file's naming convention and its internal structure. I'm focusing on defining the zip file's contents to ensure it meets the requirements.


Okay, I understand.

1.  **Understanding of Task HLG:** My primary objective for this task is to help you define the exact structure, naming, and content for a zip file. This zip file will contain a Python script (and potentially other files) and is intended for subsequent emailing. We need to clarify details like the zip file's name, its internal directory structure (e.g., script at root or in a subfolder), and if any additional files are needed, along with any specific compression or security settings.

2.  **How can I best assist you?** To get started, we can address some of the immediate Key Information Requirements. How would you like to proceed? Perhaps we can begin by deciding on:
    *   **The desired name for the zip file itself.**
    *   **Whether the Python script should be directly at the root of the zip file or placed within a subdirectory.**
