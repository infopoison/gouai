## Task Description

To identify and specify the precise requirements for the "hello world" Python script, including its content, environment, and naming conventions,.

### Initial Epistemic Uncertainties (from parent decomposition):
- Exact Python version (e.g., 3.x, specific minor) to be used for script execution.
- (python version decided as 3.10)
- Any required script headers, comments, or docstrings.
- Desired script filename and extension.
- Whether external dependencies are allowed or required for any future expansion beyond "hello world".

### Initial Key Information Requirements (from parent decomposition):
- User's preferred Python interpreter version.
- Specific "Hello World" output string requirements.
- Desired filename for the Python script.
- Any specific coding style preferences (e.g., PEP8, simple).

(This is a simple task. Formal GOUAI sections are not applicable. Outputs should be stored in the 'outputs/' directory, and LLM interactions logged in 'llm_conversation_log.md'.)
