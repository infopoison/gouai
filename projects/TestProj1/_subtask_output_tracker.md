## Sub-task (Original Temp ID: 0)

**Final HLG:**
```
To identify and specify the precise requirements for the "hello world" Python script, including its content, environment, and naming conventions,.
```

**Final EUs:**
- Exact Python version (e.g., 3.x, specific minor) to be used for script execution.
- (python version decided as 3.10)
- Any required script headers, comments, or docstrings.
- Desired script filename and extension.
- Whether external dependencies are allowed or required for any future expansion beyond "hello world".

**Final KIRQs:**
- User's preferred Python interpreter version.
- Specific "Hello World" output string requirements.
- Desired filename for the Python script.
- Any specific coding style preferences (e.g., PEP8, simple).

## Sub-task (Original Temp ID: 1)

**Final HLG:**
```
To determine the precise structure, naming, and content of the zip file, ensuring it appropriately encapsulates the Python script for subsequent emailing, as a component of the overall Workable Stated Output Descriptor.
```

**Final EUs:**
- The desired name for the zip file itself.
- Whether the Python script should be directly at the root of the zip or within a subdirectory.
- Are there any additional files (e.g., README, license, environment setup instructions) that should be included in the zip file?
- Any specific compression level or encryption requirements for the zip file.

**Final KIRQs:**
- User's desired zip file name.
- Desired directory structure within the zip file.
- List of any additional files to include in the zip.
- Any specific compression or security settings.

- **Type:** simple_task
- **Instantiated ID/Path (relative to parent):** `ST1-7_Simple_Struc`
- **Intended Output Location:** `./ST1-7_Simple_Struc/outputs/structure.txt`
- **Status:** Not Started

## Sub-task (Original Temp ID: 2)

**Final HLG:**
```
To delineate all necessary email parameters, including sender/recipient details, message content, and SMTP server configuration, to enable reliable delivery of the zip file, thereby completing the scope definition for the Workable Stated Output Descriptor.
```

**Final EUs:**
- Confirmation of the specific sender and recipient email addresses (even if "myself").
- The exact content and structure for the email subject line and body.
- Detailed SMTP server configuration (host, port, security protocols like SSL/TLS).
- The preferred method for SMTP authentication (e.g., direct password, application-specific password, OAuth token).
- Expected behavior or error handling if email sending fails.

**Final KIRQs:**
- Sender email address and display name (if any).
- Recipient email address.
- Desired email subject line.
- Desired email body text.
- SMTP server address and port.
- SMTP authentication type and required credentials.

- **Type:** simple_task
- **Instantiated ID/Path (relative to parent):** `ST1-8_Simple_to_delineate_all_necessary_email`
- **Intended Output Location:** `./ST1-8_Simple_to_delineate_all_necessary_email/outputs/primary_output.md`
- **Status:** Not Started

## Sub-task (Original Temp ID: 3)

**Final HLG:**
```
To identify the user's underlying motivations, values, and non-functional requirements (e.g., security, robustness, ease of use) for this task, ensuring the Workable Stated Output Descriptor truly serves the broader purpose and context.
```

**Final EUs:**
- Whether this is a learning exercise, a test of system capabilities, or a precursor to a more complex automation.
- The importance of error handling and robustness in the final script.
- Security considerations regarding credentials for email and file handling.
- Desired level of user interaction for the final script (e.g., fully automated, prompts for input).
- Any implicit constraints on tools, libraries, or execution environment.

**Final KIRQs:**
- User's primary motivation for executing this task.
- Specific non-functional requirements (e.g., security, performance, maintainability).
- Definition of "success" beyond just completion (e.g., ease of use, reusability).
- Any specific platform or operating system constraints.

- **Type:** simple_task
- **Instantiated ID/Path (relative to parent):** `ST1-9_Simple_to_identify_the_users_underlying`
- **Intended Output Location:** `./ST1-9_Simple_to_identify_the_users_underlying/outputs/primary_output.md`
- **Status:** Not Started
