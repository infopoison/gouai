## High-Level Goal(s) (HLG)

To delineate all necessary email parameters, including sender/recipient details, message content, and SMTP server configuration, to enable reliable delivery of the zip file, thereby completing the scope definition for the Workable Stated Output Descriptor.

Key Epistemic Uncertainties:
- Confirmation of the specific sender and recipient email addresses (even if "myself").
- The exact content and structure for the email subject line and body.
- Detailed SMTP server configuration (host, port, security protocols like SSL/TLS).
- The preferred method for SMTP authentication (e.g., direct password, application-specific password, OAuth token).
- Expected behavior or error handling if email sending fails.

Key Information Requirements:
- Sender email address and display name (if any).
- Recipient email address.
- Desired email subject line.
- Desired email body text.
- SMTP server address and port.
- SMTP authentication type and required credentials.
