**Crafting the WSOD**

I'm currently focused on distilling the user's instructions into a 'Final WSOD.' I've parsed the parent task's initial HLG: create a Python script, zip it, and email it. My next step is to define the specific attributes required for successful completion, ensuring clarity for the user's specific workflow.


**Assessing Subtask Outcomes**

I've examined the parent task's HLG ("create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself") and the lack of completed sub-task outputs. The initial WSOD was undefined, so I'm building it from scratch. My focus now is synthesizing this information to accurately reflect the situation: no deliverables were received from sub-tasks. The Final WSOD must reflect this, acknowledging the unfulfilled objective due to the lack of sub-task completion. It needs to convey the current state without redefining the original goal.


**Analyzing Current Status**

I've been analyzing the parent task's goal ("create a python script, zip, email") and the lack of subtask completions. The Final WSOD must reflect this. No outputs were received, so the parent task's objectives remain unfulfilled. It can't redefine the goal, so I'll structure it to state the current, incomplete status, noting the missing sub-task outputs prevented progress. It will clearly indicate that the desired output isn't yet produced.


**Summarizing Current State**

My focus is on synthesizing the current state of the parent task: creating, zipping, and emailing a "hello world" Python script.  No completed sub-task outputs exist. The Final WSOD must reflect this, stating that the objective is unfulfilled due to a lack of deliverables. I've drafted a description, clarifying that the initial WSOD was a placeholder. The current state is "unproduced" due to absent sub-task contributions.


**Confirming Output State**

I'm focused on the Final WSOD, considering the absent sub-task outputs. The objective, initially aimed at producing a zipped Python script and email, is currently unfulfilled. My synthesis now centers on explicitly stating this: that the desired output is "unproduced" because the necessary components are missing. This informs the user that Phase 3 cannot proceed without sub-task deliveries.


**Final Workable Stated Output Descriptor (Final WSOD)**

**Overarching Goal Confirmation:**
The overarching goal of this parent task remains to create a Python script that prints "hello world," place it in a zip file, and subsequently email this zip file to the user.

**Integration of Sub-task Findings & Achieved State:**
Based on the aggregation of sub-task outcomes, it has been determined that **no completed sub-task outputs were provided or found for aggregation.** This signifies that the necessary components required to fulfill the parent task's objective (i.e., the Python script, the zipped archive, and the action of emailing) have not been produced or delivered by their respective decomposed sub-tasks.

Therefore, the current state of the parent task's output is **unfulfilled**. The desired final artifact (a zipped "hello world" Python script emailed to the user) does not exist as a synthesizable product at this stage due to the absence of foundational inputs from its sub-tasks.

**Resolution of Initial Uncertainty:**
The initial Parent Task WSOD was "To be defined." This Final WSOD defines the current output state as 'unproduced' or 'pending critical dependencies'. It clarifies that the desired output has not materialized.

**Guidance for GOUAI Phase 3 (Output Synthesis) / Definitive Description:**
As no sub-task outputs are available, GOUAI Phase 3 (Output Synthesis) for this parent task cannot proceed. The definitive description of the completed work at this point is "None." The parent task's objective cannot be declared complete until the antecedent sub-tasks deliver their respective outputs. Remedial action, such as re-executing or troubleshooting the sub-tasks, is required to generate the necessary components before this parent task can achieve its stated goal.
