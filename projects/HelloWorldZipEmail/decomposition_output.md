**Defining the Protocol**

I'm now focusing on understanding the GOUAI protocol. I'm especially focused on Phase 1, GDE, for WSOD formulation. I'm working through the core principles to ensure a solid foundation for further application.


**Grasping the Framework**

I'm now diving deeper into the nuances of Phase 1, GDE. I'm focusing on dissecting the provided `PARENT_TASK_DEFINITION_CONTENT` to identify the Higher-Level Goal and Meta-Context. My primary aim is to translate this information into a precise Working Specification of Desired Outputs (WSOD). I'm carefully navigating the stages of GDE, ensuring my WSOD formulation aligns with the protocol's requirements.


**Clarifying the Objectives**

Now I'm delving deeper into the parent task's `HLG_summary`, intending to define the Working Specification of Desired Outputs (WSOD). I'm carefully considering all aspects of the instruction: the creation of a Python script, its format, the 'Hello World' output, the file packaging, and the emailing process. I'm focusing on clarifying ambiguous points to ensure my WSOD effectively guides subsequent steps. My current goal is a precise and actionable WSOD that captures all task requirements.


**Refining the WSOD**

I've been working on refining the Working Specification of Desired Outputs (WSOD). I'm currently focusing on addressing ambiguities in the parent task. I'm prioritizing the inclusion of detailed instructions regarding the email process, including specifying the email client, sender, recipient, subject, and attachment details, all to ensure precise and actionable sub-task instructions. My goal is to craft a WSOD that eliminates any room for misinterpretation.


**Developing a Detailed WSOD**

I've revised the parent task's Working Specification of Desired Outputs (WSOD) using the GOUAI protocol. I've focused on the email process and expanded its clarity and precision. Now, it explicitly covers email details and SMTP server credentials.  This refined specification enhances actionability and sets the stage for a thorough sub-task decomposition according to the GOUAI principles.


**Finalizing the WSOD**

I've completed my final refinement of the Working Specification of Desired Outputs (WSOD) using the GOUAI protocol. I ensured that all ambiguities are resolved, particularly details of the script, its packaging, and emailing process. The refined WSOD now acts as a comprehensive guide for the subsequent sub-task decomposition, ensuring clarity and actionability for each step. I'm now ready to decompose this WSOD into individual, manageable sub-tasks.


**Refining the Approach**

I'm now carefully working through the refined parent task, focusing on the WSOD and how to break it down. I've broken it down into subtasks: creating the Python script, zipping it, and emailing it as an attachment. I'm focusing on defining clear uncertainties (EUs) and required information (KIRQs) for each. My current focus is refining this strategy to fully align with GOUAI principles.


**Defining Subtasks**

I'm now breaking down the parent task into manageable sub-tasks. I've focused on clarity: Script creation, zipping, and emailing. I'm building EUs and KIRQs for each sub-task to guarantee an actionable plan for execution. This refinement fully aligns with GOUAI principles.


**Structuring the Plan**

I've outlined the core steps for the GOUAI protocol application. I'm now developing the sub-tasks, including their HLG, EUs, and KIRQs, for each stage. I'm focusing on ensuring clear and actionable instructions for each step within the main task. My efforts aim to align with the GOUAI principles and to provide the best possible response.


**Dissecting the Subtasks**

I'm now diving into decomposing the refined WSOD into actionable subtasks based on the GOUAI protocol. I'm focusing on "Hello World" creation, archiving, and email processes, each with their own HLG, EU, and KIRQ. I've broken each task down meticulously to ensure a complete and actionable plan.


# PARENT TASK ANALYSIS
## PARENT_HLG
To create a Python script that prints 'Hello World', place it in a ZIP file, and email it to myself.

## PARENT_WSOD
A Python script (`hello_world.py`) that, when executed in a standard Python 3 environment, prints the string 'Hello World' to standard output. This script shall be compressed into a ZIP archive named `hello_world_script.zip`, with `hello_world.py` located at the root level within the archive. Finally, this `hello_world_script.zip` attachment shall be programmatically sent via email to a user-specified recipient email address (intended to be the sender's own address), using a user-specified sender email address and SMTP server credentials. The email should have a subject line 'Hello World Python Script' and a concise body explaining the attachment.

# PROPOSED SUB-TASKS

## SUB-TASK
### HLG
To generate a Python script named `hello_world.py` that outputs "Hello World" upon execution.
### EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTIES
- The specific string literal for "Hello World" (e.g., "Hello World", "Hello, World!").
- Any additional boilerplate or comments required within the script (e.g., shebang, encoding declaration).
- Confirmation of the exact filename if `hello_world.py` is not the user's only preference.
### KEY_INFORMATION_REQUIREMENTS
- User's preferred exact output string for the script.
- Any specific requirements for script content beyond the print statement.
- Confirmation of the desired filename for the Python script.

## SUB-TASK
### HLG
To create a ZIP archive named `hello_world_script.zip` containing only the `hello_world.py` script at its root.
### EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTIES
- Confirmation of the precise desired ZIP filename.
- Any specific compression level or algorithm requirements for the ZIP file.
- The preferred method for creating the ZIP (e.g., using Python's `zipfile` module directly within a script, or assuming an external command-line tool).
### KEY_INFORMATION_REQUIREMENTS
- Confirmation of the exact desired ZIP file name.
- User's preference for the compression method (if any specific method is required).
- Validation that `hello_world.py` should be the *only* file included in the ZIP, directly at its root.

## SUB-TASK
### HLG
To programmatically send the `hello_world_script.zip` as an email attachment to a specified recipient via SMTP.
### EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTIES
- The specific SMTP server host address and port number.
- The exact sender and recipient email addresses.
- The precise authentication credentials (username, password/app password) required for the sender's email account.
- The exact subject line and body text for the email.
- The desired security protocol for SMTP (e.g., STARTTLS, SSL).
- Error handling strategy for email sending failures (e.g., retry logic, logging).
- Best practices for securely handling sensitive credentials (e.g., environment variables vs. hardcoding for demonstration).
### KEY_INFORMATION_REQUIREMENTS
- The SMTP server address and port number.
- The sender's email address and the corresponding application-specific password or equivalent credential.
- The recipient's email address.
- The exact subject line and body content for the email message.
- User's preferences for error reporting and credential management (e.g., should credentials be explicitly requested or sourced from environment variables?).
- Confirmation on the required security protocol for SMTP (e.g., `starttls`).
