## Task Description

To programmatically send the `hello_world_script.zip` as an email attachment to a specified recipient via SMTP.

### Initial Epistemic Uncertainties (from parent decomposition):
- The specific SMTP server host address and port number.
- The exact sender and recipient email addresses.
- The precise authentication credentials (username, password/app password) required for the sender's email account.
- The exact subject line and body text for the email.
- The desired security protocol for SMTP (e.g., STARTTLS, SSL).
- Error handling strategy for email sending failures (e.g., retry logic, logging).
- Best practices for securely handling sensitive credentials (e.g., environment variables vs. hardcoding for demonstration).

### Initial Key Information Requirements (from parent decomposition):
- The SMTP server address and port number.
- The sender's email address and the corresponding application-specific password or equivalent credential.
- The recipient's email address.
- The exact subject line and body content for the email message.
- User's preferences for error reporting and credential management (e.g., should credentials be explicitly requested or sourced from environment variables?).
- Confirmation on the required security protocol for SMTP (e.g., `starttls`).

(This is a simple task. Formal GOUAI sections are not applicable. Outputs should be stored in the 'outputs/' directory, and LLM interactions logged in 'llm_conversation_log.md'.)
