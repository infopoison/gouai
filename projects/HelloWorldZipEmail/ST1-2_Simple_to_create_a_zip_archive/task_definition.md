## Task Description

To create a ZIP archive named `hello_world_script.zip` containing only the `hello_world.py` script at its root.

### Initial Epistemic Uncertainties (from parent decomposition):
- Confirmation of the precise desired ZIP filename.
- Any specific compression level or algorithm requirements for the ZIP file.
- The preferred method for creating the ZIP (e.g., using Python's `zipfile` module directly within a script, or assuming an external command-line tool).

### Initial Key Information Requirements (from parent decomposition):
- Confirmation of the exact desired ZIP file name.
- User's preference for the compression method (if any specific method is required).
- Validation that `hello_world.py` should be the *only* file included in the ZIP, directly at its root.

(This is a simple task. Formal GOUAI sections are not applicable. Outputs should be stored in the 'outputs/' directory, and LLM interactions logged in 'llm_conversation_log.md'.)
