**Synthesizing the Descriptor**

I'm now generating a Final WSOD, aiming to articulate the conclusive outcome for this GOUAI task. Considering the initial HLG, I'm focusing on crafting a comprehensive descriptor that captures the essence of the "Hello World" Python script. This descriptor should detail the script's core function and expected output, making it actionable for the GOUAI to proceed effectively.


**Finalizing the Descriptor**

I've refined the WSOD by incorporating the critical lack of sub-task outputs. The final version now emphasizes that no information was generated to refine the initial 'Hello World' Python script task. I've re-evaluated the initial parameters and refined the task description to ensure it's actionable even in this state of incomplete data. I'm focusing on ensuring clear instructions for the GOUAI to proceed, even without sub-task assistance.


**Reporting On Lack of Progress**

I've revised the initial WSOD to clearly reflect the absence of completed sub-task outputs. I'm articulating that the task, which involves creating a "Hello World" Python script, zipping it, and emailing it, remains at the initial definition stage. No actionable outputs were produced by sub-tasks, and therefore, the state is essentially unchanged from the initial requirements. I'm finalizing the WSOD to accurately communicate this lack of progress, ensuring the GOUAI understands the task's status: no artifacts have been created.


**Defining No-Output State**

I'm now stating the current state as a lack of progress from any supporting sub-tasks. The Final WSOD will define the task as it was originally intended: to create and deliver a "Hello World" Python script. However, the WSOD will explicitly state that no outputs were received from any sub-tasks, meaning the actual production of these components remains unaddressed. It serves as a directive for Phase 3, if needed, to generate the anticipated "Hello World" script, zipped file, and email based on the unchanged initial specifications.


**Clarifying Task Status**

I'm now stating the current state reflects no progress from sub-task executions. The final WSOD will describe the intended Python script, zip file, and email. However, it will explicitly note that no outputs have been received from any sub-tasks, indicating that no components are currently generated. This lack of sub-task feedback signals that the task remains in its initial, undefined state. It serves as a directive for Phase 3 to generate the expected components as per the original specifications, if needed.


**Summarizing Task Status**

I'm now generating a Final WSOD that reflects a crucial lack of progress. While the intended outcome is to create a Python script, zip it, and email it, sub-tasks have not reported generating the required artifacts. The Final WSOD will define the target outputs, but it must clearly state the absence of delivered sub-task outputs, effectively indicating the task remains unfulfilled. This is to ensure Phase 3 clearly understands what has *not* been produced.


**Reflecting Lack of Outputs**

I'm now integrating the absence of sub-task outputs into the final WSOD. While the goal remains creating and delivering a "Hello World" Python script via email, sub-tasks failed to generate the required components. The Final WSOD details the target outputs but explicitly states no artifacts were produced. This reflects a non-completion state, informing Phase 3 to generate the outputs as per the initial specifications.


**Final Workable Stated Output Descriptor (Final WSOD)**

**Overarching Goal Confirmation:**
The overarching goal remains to successfully create a Python script that prints 'Hello World', compress it into a ZIP file, and programmatically send this ZIP file as an email attachment to a specified recipient.

**Achieved State / Refined Plan & Outputs:**
The definition of the desired final output remains consistent with the initial specification. This entails:

1.  **Python Script (`hello_world.py`):** A Python 3 compatible script designed to print the string 'Hello World' to standard output when executed.
2.  **ZIP Archive (`hello_world_script.zip`):** A compressed archive containing the `hello_world.py` script at its root level.
3.  **Email:** An email with the `hello_world_script.zip` attached, sent programmatically via SMTP.
    *   **Subject Line:** 'Hello World Python Script'
    *   **Body:** A concise explanation of the attachment.
    *   **Recipient:** A user-specified email address.
    *   **Sender & Credentials:** A user-specified sender email address and corresponding SMTP server credentials (host, port, authentication details).

**Synthesis of Sub-task Outcomes:**
Based on the aggregated sub-task outcomes, it is noted that **no completed outputs were provided or found for aggregation**. This means that, despite the detailed definition of the desired artifacts, the decomposed sub-tasks responsible for generating the `hello_world.py` script, the `hello_world_script.zip` file, or the dispatched email have not reported completion or delivered their respective outputs.

**Conclusion:**
While the specific functional and structural requirements for the final output are clearly defined and confirmed, the actual production and delivery of these components by the sub-tasks have not occurred or been reported within the scope of this synthesis. Consequently, this Final WSOD primarily serves as a definitive specification of the *intended* outcome, rather than a description of *achieved* artifacts. Any subsequent GOUAI Phase 3 (Output Synthesis) would operate on this definition, but without tangible outputs to synthesize.
