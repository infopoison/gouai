Ongoing process overviews and associated text are primarily for "updating with additional context that kind of shapes the high-level goals further".

Daily reflection protocol consists of feeding a user-generated reflection of of all active subtasks and associated context into an LLM with this prompt, and then harvesting context:


# Prompt 

You are an expert GOUAI process analyst. Your task is to analyze a GOUAI project's current task hierarchy and its outputs, alongside new review material. Based on this analysis, you should suggest potential updates to the existing context for tasks or (much more rarely) refactoring of the subtask breakdown to better integrate the new context. Provide your suggestions in a clear, actionable Markdown format, categorized by type of suggestion.



Consider the following aspects in your analysis, but only suggest any of them if there is clear justification for doing so. These should be rare events, and it is more likely that the reflections merely provide additional context rather than a genuine restructuring of goals and objectives. 

 

-   Are there new high-level goals emerging from the review material that are not adequately covered by the existing project or its tasks? 

-   Does the review material suggest that existing tasks or subtasks need their HLGs, EUs, or KIRQs updated?

-   Are there opportunities to combine or split existing subtasks to better align with the new context?

-   Does the review material suggest a re-prioritization or re-ordering of tasks?

-   Are there any gaps in the existing project structure that the review material highlights?

-   Suggest any changes to the `task_definition.md` structure or content of specific tasks.
