**Initiating Project Analysis**

I'm starting the process of analyzing the `task_definition.md` files to generate a "Project Status Summary." My focus is on extracting the overall project goals and their current status from the main project file located at `./projects/TestProj1/task_definition.md`. This initial step involves identifying the key information within the specified files.


**Constructing Summaries**

I've progressed to focusing on parsing the specific information.  I'm extracting the overall project goal and current status from the main project file (`./projects/TestProj1/task_definition.md`), prioritizing `HLG_summary` over `WSOD_summary`.  The initial status is "Not Started," with a high-level goal defined. Now I am shifting gears to examining sub-task information, specifically looking for `task_id`, summaries, and status within the nested task files.


**Detailing Sub-Task Extraction**

I've successfully identified the overall project goal and current status. Now, I'm delving into the sub-task data, focusing on the `task_id`, summaries, and status within the sub-task files. I'm prioritizing `HLG_summary` where available. My plan is to structure the output to include a concise overview of both the project and its sub-tasks.


# Project Status Summary

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Status

*   **Project ID:** `TestProj1_ROOT`
*   **High-Level Goal:** To create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself.
*   **Current Status:** Not Started

## 2. Sub-Task Overview

*   **Task ID:** `TestProj1_ROOT_ST1-1_ParentHLGTest`
    *   **HLG/Description:** To create a python script that prints hello world and then place it in a zip file and email it to myself.
    *   **Current Status:** Not Started

## 3. Key Accomplishments

*   No specific accomplishments to report at this time, as all tasks are currently in a "Not Started" status.

## 4. Blockers or Critical Uncertainties

*   No critical blockers or specific uncertainties are currently discernible from the provided task definitions, as the project and its sub-tasks are in the "Not Started" phase with many planning sections (e.g., WSOD, uncertainties) marked "To be filled."
